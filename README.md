# gotstate-rs

A production-ready hierarchical finite state machine (HFSM) library for Rust, focusing on reliability, safety, and ease of use.

## Features

- Hierarchical state machines with composite states
- Type-safe state and event handling
- Thread-safe event processing
- Guard conditions and transition actions
- State data management with proper lifecycle
- Timeout events
- History states (both shallow and deep)
- Comprehensive error handling
- Activation hooks for monitoring and extending behavior

## Status

ðŸš§ **Under Development** ðŸš§

This crate is currently in active development. While the API is being stabilized, breaking changes may occur.

## Design Philosophy

`gotstate-rs` is designed with the following principles:

- **Safety First**: Leverage Rust's type system to prevent runtime errors
- **Clear Interfaces**: Intuitive API that guides users toward correct usage
- **Production Ready**: Built for real-world applications with proper error handling
- **Performance**: Minimal overhead while maintaining safety guarantees
- **Flexibility**: Support for various use cases without compromising core functionality

## Example

```rust
// Example code will be added once implementation begins
```

## Installation

Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
gotstate-rs = "0.1.0"  # Note: Not yet published
```

## Documentation
