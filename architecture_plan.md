### Progress

- Created class-level architecture for core components:
  - Defined comprehensive class invariants

  - ExecutionUnit for atomic operations
  - ResourceManager for control

- Implemented Persistence components:
  - Serializer with format support
  - Validator with rule checking
  - FormatHandler for conversions
  - MigrationHandler for versions
  - ValidationContext for state

- Implemented Type system:
  - BaseType with template pattern
  - PrimitiveType for core types
  - CompositeType for structures
  - GenericType for parameters
  - TypeRegistry for management

- Implemented Extension system:
  - ExtensionHooks for customization

  - RecoveryHandler for errors

### Next Steps

## 4. Interface/Method/Property Level

[To be designed after Class level approval]

The Interface/Method/Property level will define:

1. Method signatures and types
2. Property access patterns
3. Interface contracts
4. Error conditions
5. Threading guarantees
6. Performance constraints
