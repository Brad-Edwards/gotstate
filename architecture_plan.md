# Architecture Levels

## 1. Package Level (gotstate)

### Current Level Repository Structure

```
gotstate/              # Main package directory
├── README.md         # Package architecture documentation
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization and docstring

docs/
└── diagrams/         # Architecture diagrams
    ├── package_boundaries.md      # Package boundaries and interactions
    └── cross_cutting_concerns.md  # Cross-cutting concerns visualization
```

### Progress

- Created package-level architecture documentation in README.md
- Established package initialization with architecture docstring in __init__.py
- Defined package responsibilities, interactions, and cross-cutting concerns
- Created Mermaid diagrams visualizing package boundaries and cross-cutting concerns

### Next Steps

- Await review of Package level architecture
- After approval, proceed to File level design

## 2. File Level

[To be designed after Package level review]

## 3. Class Level

[To be designed after File level]

## 4. Interface/Method/Property Level
