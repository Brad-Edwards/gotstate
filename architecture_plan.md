# Architecture Levels

## 1. Package Level (gotstate)

### Current Level Repository Structure

```
gotstate/              # Main package directory
├── README.md         # Package architecture documentation
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization and docstring

docs/
├── package_api.md    # Public API and security boundaries
├── extension_points.md # Extension mechanisms
└── diagrams/         # Architecture diagrams
    ├── package_boundaries.md      # Package boundaries and interactions
    └── cross_cutting_concerns.md  # Cross-cutting concerns visualization
```

### Assessment Findings

1. Completeness (7/10):
   - Missing public API documentation
   - Package configuration undefined
   - Version management needs detail

2. Consistency (9/10):
   - Minor inconsistency in external dependency descriptions

3. Clarity (8/10):
   - Extension points need better documentation
   - Package boundaries could be clearer

4. Integration (7/10):
   - Security boundaries undefined
   - Package-level interfaces need specification

### Improvement Plan

1. API Documentation
   - [x] Create docs/package_api.md defining public interfaces
   - [x] Document configuration options and defaults
   - [x] Add version compatibility matrix

2. Package Boundaries
   - [x] Update package_boundaries.md to show security boundaries
   - [x] Add validation checkpoints at package interfaces
   - [x] Standardize external dependency documentation

3. Extension Points
   - [x] Document extension interfaces in docs/extension_points.md
   - [x] Add extension points to package diagrams
   - [x] Define extension validation requirements

### Progress

- Created package-level architecture documentation in README.md
- Established package initialization with architecture docstring in __init__.py
- Defined package responsibilities, interactions, and cross-cutting concerns
- Created Mermaid diagrams visualizing package boundaries and cross-cutting concerns
- Added comprehensive API documentation with security boundaries
- Documented extension points with validation requirements
- Updated diagrams to show security boundaries and validation checkpoints
- Requested review of Package level architecture
- Received approval for Package level architecture

### Next Steps

## 2. File Level

[To be designed after Package level review]

## 3. Class Level

[To be designed after File level]

## 4. Interface/Method/Property Level

[To be designed after Class level]
