# Architecture Levels

## 1. Package Level (gotstate)

### Current Level Repository Structure

```
gotstate/              # Main package directory
├── README.md         # Package architecture documentation
└── __init__.py       # Package initialization and docstring

docs/
├── package_api.md    # Public API and security boundaries
├── extension_points.md # Extension mechanisms
└── diagrams/         # Architecture diagrams
    ├── package_boundaries.md      # Package boundaries and interactions
    └── cross_cutting_concerns.md  # Cross-cutting concerns visualization
```

### Assessment Findings

1. Completeness (7/10):
   - Missing public API documentation
   - Package configuration undefined
   - Version management needs detail

2. Consistency (9/10):
   - Minor inconsistency in external dependency descriptions

3. Clarity (8/10):
   - Extension points need better documentation
   - Package boundaries could be clearer

4. Integration (7/10):
   - Security boundaries undefined
   - Package-level interfaces need specification

### Improvement Plan

1. API Documentation
   - [x] Create docs/package_api.md defining public interfaces
   - [x] Document configuration options and defaults
   - [x] Add version compatibility matrix

2. Package Boundaries
   - [x] Update package_boundaries.md to show security boundaries
   - [x] Add validation checkpoints at package interfaces
   - [x] Standardize external dependency documentation

3. Extension Points
   - [x] Document extension interfaces in docs/extension_points.md
   - [x] Add extension points to package diagrams
   - [x] Define extension validation requirements

### Progress

- Created package-level architecture documentation in README.md
- Established package initialization with architecture docstring in __init__.py
- Defined package responsibilities, interactions, and cross-cutting concerns
- Created Mermaid diagrams visualizing package boundaries and cross-cutting concerns
- Added comprehensive API documentation with security boundaries
- Documented extension points with validation requirements
- Updated diagrams to show security boundaries and validation checkpoints
- Requested review of Package level architecture
- Received approval for Package level architecture

### Next Steps

## 2. File Level

├── runtime/           # Execution and monitoring
├── persistence/       # Storage and validation

    └── file/
        └── file_architecture.md  # File level architecture documentation
```

### Progress

- Created file-level architecture documentation
- Defined module structure and responsibilities
- Specified cross-module contracts
- Identified design patterns and dependencies
- Established security boundaries
- Defined version management approach
- Documented cross-cutting concerns
- Requested review of File level architecture

### Improvement Plan

1. Component Interactions
   - [ ] Create component_contracts.md defining high-level contracts between components
   - [ ] Document component responsibilities and dependencies
   - [ ] Define component lifecycle and state management
   - [ ] Specify component boundaries and integration points

2. Module Communication
   - [ ] Create interaction_protocols.md defining concrete protocols
   - [ ] Document message sequences for key operations
   - [ ] Specify synchronization requirements
   - [ ] Define error handling and recovery protocols

3. Error Standardization
   - [ ] Create error_handling.md defining standard error patterns
   - [ ] Document error hierarchies and propagation paths
   - [ ] Specify recovery mechanisms for each error type
   - [ ] Define logging requirements for errors

4. Runtime Architecture
   - [ ] Enhance runtime package documentation with detailed responsibilities
   - [ ] Document concurrency model and thread safety
   - [ ] Specify resource management and cleanup
   - [ ] Define monitoring and metrics interfaces

5. Pattern Consistency
   - [ ] Document design patterns used in each component
   - [ ] Ensure consistent pattern application
   - [ ] Create pattern_catalog.md for reference
   - [ ] Define when each pattern should be used

6. Cross-cutting Implementation
   - [ ] Create cross_cutting_impl.md defining implementation standards
   - [ ] Document thread safety implementation patterns
   - [ ] Specify logging and monitoring implementations
   - [ ] Define security boundary implementations

### Next Steps

1. Create new architecture documentation:
   - component_contracts.md
   - interaction_protocols.md
   - error_handling.md
   - pattern_catalog.md
   - cross_cutting_impl.md

2. Update existing documentation:
   - Enhance runtime package docs
   - Add pattern documentation to all components
   - Expand cross-cutting concerns implementation

3. Review and validate:
   - Verify interface completeness
   - Check protocol consistency
   - Validate error handling patterns
   - Confirm thread safety documentation

## 3. Class Level

[To be designed after File level]

## 4. Interface/Method/Property Level

[To be designed after Class level]
