State machine monitoring and metrics management.

Architecture:
- Provides introspection capabilities
- Emits state machine events
- Tracks execution metrics
- Coordinates with all modules
- Maintains monitoring boundaries

Design Patterns:
- Observer Pattern: State monitoring
- Publisher/Subscriber: Event emission
- Strategy Pattern: Metric collection
- Decorator Pattern: Monitoring hooks
- Chain of Responsibility: Event filtering

Responsibilities:
1. State Introspection
   - Current state access
   - Active transitions
   - Event status
   - Machine configuration
   - Runtime metrics

2. Event Emission
   - State changes
   - Transition events
   - Event handling
   - Error conditions
   - Resource usage

3. Metric Collection
   - Execution timing
   - Resource usage
   - Event statistics
   - Error rates
   - Performance data

4. Monitoring Control
   - Filter configuration
   - Metric selection
   - Event filtering
   - Resource limits
   - Data retention

Security:
- Data protection
- Access control
- Resource limits
- Event filtering

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance impact
- Resource usage
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- machine.py: Machine monitoring
- executor.py: Execution metrics
- scheduler.py: Timer metrics
- event.py: Event monitoring
