"""
Time and change event scheduling management.

Architecture:
- Manages time and change events
- Maintains timer consistency
- Coordinates with Event for queuing
- Integrates with Executor for processing
- Handles timer interruptions

Design Patterns:
- Singleton Pattern: Timer management
- Observer Pattern: Time events
- Command Pattern: Scheduled actions
- Strategy Pattern: Scheduling policies
- Chain of Responsibility: Event handling

Responsibilities:
1. Time Events
   - Relative time events
   - Absolute time events
   - Timer management
   - Timer cancellation
   - Timer interruption

2. Change Events
   - Change detection
   - State condition evaluation
   - Change event triggers
   - Condition monitoring
   - Event generation

3. Timer Management
   - Timer creation
   - Timer cancellation
   - Timer interruption
   - Timer state preservation
   - Timer recovery

4. Event Coordination
   - Event queuing
   - Priority handling
   - Order preservation
   - Timer synchronization
   - Resource management

Security:
- Timer isolation
- Resource limits
- Event validation
- State protection

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Timer metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- event.py: Event processing
- executor.py: Event execution
- monitor.py: Timer monitoring
- machine.py: Machine context
