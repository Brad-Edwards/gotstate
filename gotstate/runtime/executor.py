"""
Event execution and run-to-completion management.

Architecture:
- Enforces run-to-completion semantics
- Manages transition execution
- Handles concurrent operations
- Coordinates with Event for processing
- Integrates with Monitor for metrics

Design Patterns:
- State Pattern: Execution states
- Command Pattern: Execution units
- Observer Pattern: Execution events
- Strategy Pattern: Execution policies
- Chain of Responsibility: Event processing

Responsibilities:
1. Run-to-Completion
   - Event processing semantics
   - Event queuing
   - Transition atomicity
   - Order preservation
   - Re-entrancy handling

2. Transition Execution
   - Guard evaluation
   - Action execution
   - State changes
   - Error recovery
   - Resource cleanup

3. Concurrency
   - Parallel execution
   - Synchronization
   - Resource management
   - Deadlock prevention
   - Race condition handling

4. Error Management
   - Execution failures
   - Partial completion
   - State recovery
   - Resource cleanup
   - Error propagation

Security:
- Execution isolation
- Resource boundaries
- Action sandboxing
- State protection

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Execution metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- event.py: Event processing
- transition.py: Transition handling
- monitor.py: Execution monitoring
- machine.py: Machine context
