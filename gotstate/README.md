# gotstate Package Architecture

## Responsibilities

The gotstate package provides a Python implementation of UML-compliant Hierarchical Finite State Machines (HFSM). It is responsible for:

- State machine definition and execution
- Event processing and transition management  
- Hierarchical state composition
- Parallel region handling
- History state tracking
- Runtime validation

## Interactions

The package interacts with:

- Client code through its public API
- Python type system for static/runtime type checking
- Operating system for concurrency primitives
- Storage systems for persistence
- Logging system for diagnostics

## Cross-cutting Concerns

### Thread Safety

- All public APIs must be thread-safe
- Internal state protected by appropriate locks
- Documented thread safety guarantees per component

### Error Handling  

- Structured error hierarchy
- Consistent error reporting
- Clean error recovery paths

### Logging

- Structured logging format
- Configurable verbosity levels
- Performance impact minimized

### Performance

- O(1) state lookup where possible
- Bounded memory usage
- Predictable latency

### Security

- Input validation on all public APIs
- Safe serialization/deserialization
- Protected internal state
