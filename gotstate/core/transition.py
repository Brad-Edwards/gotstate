"""
Transition types and behavior management.

Architecture:
- Implements transition type hierarchy and behavior
- Manages transition execution and actions
- Resolves transition conflicts
- Coordinates with State for state changes
- Integrates with Event for triggers

Design Patterns:
- Command Pattern: Transition execution
- Strategy Pattern: Transition types
- Chain of Responsibility: Guard evaluation
- Observer Pattern: Transition notifications
- Template Method: Transition execution steps

Responsibilities:
1. Transition Types
   - External transitions
   - Internal transitions
   - Local transitions
   - Compound transitions
   - Protocol transitions

2. Transition Behavior
   - Guard conditions
   - Actions execution
   - Source/target validation
   - Completion transitions
   - Time/change triggers

3. Semantic Resolution
   - Conflict resolution
   - Priority handling
   - Simultaneous transitions
   - Cross-region coordination
   - Execution ordering

4. Error Handling
   - Partial completion
   - Guard evaluation errors
   - Action execution failures
   - State consistency
   - Resource cleanup

Security:
- Action execution isolation
- Guard evaluation boundaries
- Resource usage control
- State change validation

Cross-cutting:
- Error propagation
- Performance monitoring
- Transition metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- state.py: State change coordination
- event.py: Event trigger integration
- region.py: Cross-region transitions
- machine.py: Machine context
