Parallel region and concurrency management.

Architecture:
- Implements parallel region execution
- Manages region synchronization
- Handles cross-region transitions
- Coordinates with State for hierarchy
- Integrates with Executor for concurrency

Design Patterns:
- Composite Pattern: Region hierarchy
- Observer Pattern: Region events
- Mediator Pattern: Region coordination
- State Pattern: Region lifecycle
- Strategy Pattern: Execution policies

Responsibilities:
1. Parallel Execution
   - True parallel regions
   - State consistency
   - Cross-region transitions
   - Join/fork pseudostates
   - Event ordering

2. Region Synchronization
   - State consistency
   - Event processing
   - Synchronization points
   - Race condition prevention
   - Resource coordination

3. Region Lifecycle
   - Initialization sequence
   - Termination order
   - History restoration
   - Cross-region coordination
   - Data consistency

4. Event Management
   - Event ordering
   - Event propagation
   - Priority handling
   - Scope boundaries
   - Processing rules

Security:
- Region isolation
- Resource boundaries
- State protection
- Event validation

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Region metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- state.py: State hierarchy
- event.py: Event processing
- executor.py: Parallel execution
- machine.py: Machine context
