"""
Event processing and queue management.

Architecture:
- Implements event processing and queue management
- Handles event patterns and ordering
- Maintains event processing semantics
- Coordinates with Executor for processing
- Integrates with Scheduler for time events

Design Patterns:
- Observer Pattern: Event notifications
- Command Pattern: Event execution
- Strategy Pattern: Processing patterns
- Queue Pattern: Event queuing
- Chain of Responsibility: Event handling

Responsibilities:
1. Event Processing
   - Synchronous processing
   - Asynchronous processing
   - Event deferral
   - Priority handling
   - Completion events

2. Event Queue
   - Queue management
   - Event ordering
   - Event cancellation
   - Timeout handling
   - Event filtering

3. Processing Patterns
   - Single consumption
   - Broadcast events
   - Conditional events
   - Event scoping
   - Priority rules

4. Run-to-Completion
   - RTC semantics
   - Queue during transitions
   - Order preservation
   - Re-entrant processing
   - Timeout handling

Security:
- Event validation
- Queue protection
- Resource monitoring
- Processing boundaries

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Event metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- transition.py: Event triggers
- executor.py: Event execution
- scheduler.py: Time events
- machine.py: Machine context
