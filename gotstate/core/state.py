"""
State class and hierarchy management.

Architecture:
- Implements hierarchical state structure using Composite pattern
- Manages state data with isolation guarantees
- Enforces state invariants and validation
- Coordinates with Region for parallel state execution
- Preserves history state information

Design Patterns:
- Composite Pattern: Hierarchical state structure
- Observer Pattern: State change notifications
- Memento Pattern: History state preservation
- Builder Pattern: State configuration
- Visitor Pattern: State traversal

Responsibilities:
1. State Hierarchy
   - Parent/child relationships
   - Composite state management
   - Submachine state handling
   - State redefinition support

2. State Data
   - Data isolation between states
   - Parent state data inheritance
   - Parallel region data management
   - History state data preservation

3. State Behavior
   - Entry/exit actions
   - Do-activity execution
   - Internal transitions
   - State invariants

4. State Configuration
   - Initial/final states
   - History state types
   - Entry/exit points
   - Choice/junction pseudostates

Security:
- State data isolation
- Action execution boundaries
- Resource usage monitoring
- Validation at state boundaries

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling for state operations
- Performance optimization for traversal
- Monitoring of state changes
- Thread safety for parallel regions

Dependencies:
- region.py: Parallel region coordination
- transition.py: State change management
- event.py: Event processing integration
- machine.py: State machine context
