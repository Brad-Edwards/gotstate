    The State class implements the Composite pattern to manage the hierarchical
    structure of states. It maintains parent-child relationships, handles state
    data with proper isolation, and coordinates with parallel regions.
    
    Class Invariants:
    1. A state must have a unique identifier within its parent's scope
    2. A state's type must not change after initialization
    3. Parent-child relationships must form a directed acyclic graph (DAG)
    4. Initial pseudostates must have exactly one outgoing transition
    5. History states must belong to a composite state
    6. Entry/exit points must have valid connections
    7. State data must remain isolated between parallel regions

    - Stack for history state tracking

    Resource Management:
    1. Bounded memory usage for state data
    2. Controlled resource allocation for do-activities
    3. Limited thread pool for parallel regions
