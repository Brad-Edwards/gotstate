Type system extension management.

Architecture:
- Provides type extension points
- Manages type conversions
- Maintains type consistency
- Coordinates with base types
- Integrates with sandbox

Design Patterns:
- Plugin Pattern: Type extensions
- Adapter Pattern: Type conversion
- Decorator Pattern: Type wrapping
- Strategy Pattern: Extension behavior
- Chain of Responsibility: Type handling

Responsibilities:
1. Extension Management
   - Extension registration
   - Extension lifecycle
   - Extension validation
   - Extension isolation
   - Resource control

2. Type Conversion
   - Conversion rules
   - Type mapping
   - Data transformation
   - Validation hooks
   - Error handling

3. Type Integration
   - Base type coordination
   - Extension composition
   - Type compatibility
   - Version management
   - Extension interfaces

4. Extension Safety
   - Type validation
   - Resource limits
   - Isolation boundaries
   - Error containment
   - Security checks

Security:
- Extension isolation
- Type safety
- Resource control
- Access validation

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Extension metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- base.py: Core types
- sandbox.py: Extension isolation
- validator.py: Type validation
- monitor.py: Extension monitoring
