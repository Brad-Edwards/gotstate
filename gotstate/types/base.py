Core type system definitions and management.

Architecture:
- Defines core type system
- Specifies type compatibility
- Manages type safety
- Coordinates with validation
- Integrates with extensions

Design Patterns:
- Factory Pattern: Type creation
- Strategy Pattern: Type operations

Responsibilities:
1. Type System
   - Core types
   - Type hierarchy
   - Type relationships
   - Type constraints
   - Type operations

2. Type Safety
   - Type checking
   - Type conversion
   - Type validation
   - Error handling
   - Safety guarantees

3. Type Management
   - Type registration
   - Type lookup
   - Type caching
   - Type versioning
   - Type metadata

4. Type Integration
   - Extension support
   - Validation hooks
   - Conversion bridges
   - Serialization
   - Type evolution

Security:
- Type validation
- Operation safety
- Resource limits
- Access control

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Type metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- extensions.py: Type extensions
- validator.py: Type validation
