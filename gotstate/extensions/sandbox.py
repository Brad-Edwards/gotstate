"""
Extension isolation and security management.

Architecture:
- Implements extension isolation
- Enforces resource boundaries
- Manages extension security
- Coordinates with hooks
- Maintains extension guarantees

Design Patterns:
- Proxy Pattern: Extension isolation
- Strategy Pattern: Security policies
- Observer Pattern: Resource monitoring
- Decorator Pattern: Security wrapping
- Chain of Responsibility: Security checks

Responsibilities:
1. Extension Isolation
   - Resource boundaries
   - Memory limits
   - CPU constraints
   - I/O restrictions
   - Network control

2. Security Management
   - Access control
   - Permission checking
   - Resource validation
   - Operation monitoring
   - Threat prevention

3. Resource Control
   - Usage monitoring
   - Limit enforcement
   - Resource cleanup
   - Leak prevention
   - Performance tracking

4. Extension Safety
   - State protection
   - Data isolation
   - Error containment
   - Recovery handling
   - Security boundaries

Security:
- Sandbox enforcement
- Resource isolation
- Access control
- Threat mitigation

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Security metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- hooks.py: Extension lifecycle
- monitor.py: Resource tracking
- validator.py: Security validation
- machine.py: State protection
