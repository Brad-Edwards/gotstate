"""
Extension interface and lifecycle management.

Architecture:
- Defines extension interfaces
- Manages extension lifecycle
- Provides customization points
- Coordinates with sandbox
- Integrates with modules

Design Patterns:
- Plugin Pattern: Extension points
- Observer Pattern: Extension events
- Template Method: Hook methods
- Strategy Pattern: Extension behavior
- Chain of Responsibility: Hook chaining

Responsibilities:
1. Extension Interfaces
   - Hook definitions
   - Extension points
   - Interface contracts
   - Version support
   - API stability

2. Lifecycle Management
   - Extension loading
   - Initialization
   - Activation
   - Deactivation
   - Cleanup

3. Customization Points
   - State behavior
   - Event processing
   - Persistence
   - Monitoring
   - Type system

4. Integration
   - Module coordination
   - Event propagation
   - Resource sharing
   - Error handling
   - State access

Security:
- Interface validation
- Resource control
- Access boundaries
- Extension isolation
- Security checks

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance monitoring
- Extension metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- sandbox.py: Extension isolation
- machine.py: State machine access
- monitor.py: Extension monitoring
- validator.py: Interface validation
