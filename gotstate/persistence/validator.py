"""
State machine definition validation management.

Architecture:
- Validates state machine definitions
- Ensures semantic consistency
- Verifies transition rules
- Coordinates with all modules
- Maintains validation boundaries

Design Patterns:
- Visitor Pattern: Structure validation
- Chain of Responsibility: Rule checking
- Strategy Pattern: Validation rules
- Observer Pattern: Validation events
- Composite Pattern: Rule composition

Responsibilities:
1. Definition Validation
   - State hierarchy
   - Transition rules
   - Event definitions
   - Region structure
   - Extension configs

2. Semantic Validation
   - UML compliance
   - State consistency
   - Transition validity
   - Event handling
   - Region coordination

3. Rule Management
   - Rule definition
   - Rule composition
   - Rule priorities
   - Rule dependencies
   - Rule execution

4. Error Handling
   - Error detection
   - Error reporting
   - Error context
   - Recovery options
   - Validation status

Security:
- Input validation
- Rule isolation
- Resource limits
- Access control

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Validation metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- serializer.py: Format validation
- machine.py: Structure access
- types.py: Type validation
- monitor.py: Validation tracking
