"""
State machine serialization and persistence management.

Architecture:
- Handles state machine persistence
- Preserves runtime state
- Maintains version compatibility
- Coordinates with Validator
- Integrates with Types

Design Patterns:
- Strategy Pattern: Storage formats
- Builder Pattern: State loading
- Memento Pattern: State capture
- Adapter Pattern: Format conversion
- Factory Pattern: Format handlers

Responsibilities:
1. State Persistence
   - Machine definition
   - Runtime state
   - History states
   - Version information
   - Extension data

2. Format Management
   - Format validation
   - Version compatibility
   - Schema evolution
   - Data migration
   - Format conversion

3. State Recovery
   - State restoration
   - History recovery
   - Version migration
   - Error recovery
   - Partial loading

4. Version Control
   - Version tracking
   - Compatibility checks
   - Breaking changes
   - Migration paths
   - Version metadata

Security:
- Data validation
- Format verification
- Resource limits
- Access control

Cross-cutting:
- Error handling
- Performance optimization
- Storage metrics
- Thread safety

Dependencies:
- validator.py: Format validation
- machine.py: State access
- types.py: Type serialization
- monitor.py: Operation tracking
