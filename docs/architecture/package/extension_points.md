# Package Extension Points

## Overview

The gotstate package provides controlled extension points that maintain package boundaries and security guarantees. All extensions must operate within the package's security and validation framework.

## Extension Categories

### 1. State Behavior Extensions

Extension point for customizing state behavior while maintaining package boundaries:

- Must implement security interface
- Resource usage monitored
- Validation at package boundary

### 2. Event Processing Extensions

Extension point for custom event handling with security controls:

- Sandboxed execution environment
- Event format validation
- Rate limiting enforcement

### 3. Persistence Extensions

Extension point for storage customization with safety guarantees:

- Safe serialization/deserialization
- Format validation
- Resource constraints

### 4. Configuration Extensions

Extension point for custom configuration management:

- Configuration providers
  - Custom configuration sources
  - Environment integration
  - Dynamic configuration
  - Secure credential management

- Configuration validators
  - Custom validation rules
  - Schema extensions
  - Format validation
  - Security policy validation

- Configuration storage
  - Custom storage backends
  - Format converters
  - Migration handlers
  - Version management

## Extension Requirements

1. Security
   - Must operate within security boundary
   - No direct access to internal state
   - Resource usage limits

2. Validation
   - Input/output validation
   - Type safety checks
   - Format verification

3. Resource Management
   - Memory limits
   - Thread pool constraints
   - I/O restrictions

## Extension Lifecycle

1. Registration
   - Validation of extension interface
   - Security boundary check
   - Resource limit assignment

2. Activation
   - Sandbox initialization
   - Validation framework setup
   - Monitoring activation

3. Deactivation
   - Resource cleanup
   - State validation
   - Safe shutdown

## Extension Boundaries

1. Package Interface
   - Controlled access to package features
   - Validated data exchange
   - Protected state access

2. Resource Boundaries
   - Isolated execution context
   - Monitored resource usage
   - Rate limiting enforcement

3. Security Boundaries
   - Input/output validation
   - State protection
   - Access control enforcement

4. Configuration Boundaries
   - Configuration isolation
   - Secure credential handling
   - Change validation
   - Atomic updates
