# Model Checking Companion Tool Requirements

## 1. Introduction
1.1 The model checking companion tool provides formal verification capabilities for gotstate hierarchical finite state machines. It enables verification of safety and liveness properties, deadlock detection, and state space analysis.

## 2. Terms and Definitions
2.1 Model Checking: Systematic verification of system properties through state space exploration
2.2 Safety Property: A property stating that "something bad never happens"
2.3 Liveness Property: A property stating that "something good eventually happens"
2.4 State Space: The set of all possible states and transitions in a state machine
2.5 Counterexample: A sequence of states/transitions that violates a specified property
2.6 Temporal Logic: Formal logic for specifying time-dependent properties
2.7 Invariant: A property that must hold true in all reachable states
