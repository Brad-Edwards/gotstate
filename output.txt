This package provides a robust implementation of hierarchical state machines following
UML state machine semantics.

Responsibilities:
    - State machine definition and execution
    - Event processing and transition management
    - Hierarchical state composition 
    - Parallel region handling

Cross-cutting Concerns:
    Thread Safety:
        - All public APIs are thread-safe
        - Internal state protected by appropriate locks
        - Documented thread safety guarantees per component

    Error Handling:
        - Structured error hierarchy
        - Consistent error reporting
        - Clean error recovery paths

    Logging:
        - Structured logging format
        - Configurable verbosity levels
        - Performance impact minimized

    Performance:
        - O(1) state lookup where possible
