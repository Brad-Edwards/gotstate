## **1. Introduction**

This document outlines the requirements for a hierarchical finite state machine (FSM) library intended for production use. The library **MUST** be language-agnostic and suitable for implementation in multiple programming languages. It is designed to provide a solid foundation for state machine behaviors, focusing on the most common and essential functionalities necessary for a principal software engineer to commence implementation design.

## **2. Terms and Definitions**

### **2.1 State Machine**

- **8.8** **MUST** validate that the library maintains deterministic behavior under concurrent and asynchronous operations.

## **9. Glossary**

- **Asynchronous**: Processing that occurs independently of the main program flow, allowing other operations to continue.
- **Atomicity**: Ensuring operations are completed entirely or not at all, preventing partial updates.
- **Composite State**: A state containing nested substates.
- **Determinism**: Consistent behavior, producing the same output given the same inputs and initial state.
- **Event**: An occurrence that may trigger transitions or actions within the state machine.
- **Fallback State**: A predefined state the state machine transitions to upon encountering an unrecoverable error.
- **FSM**: Finite State Machine.
- **Guard Condition**: A boolean expression that determines whether a transition should occur.
- **History State**: Remembers the previous active substate upon re-entry into a composite state.
- **Immutable**: Unchangeable after creation.
- **Scope**: The context within which identifiers are unique.
- **Side-effect-free**: Operations that do not modify any state or have observable effects outside their context.
- **State**: A distinct condition or situation in the state machine.
- **Thread Safety**: Safe execution in a multi-threaded environment without unintended interactions.
- **Timeout Event**: An event automatically generated after a specified duration.
- **Transition**: The change from one state to another in response to an event.
