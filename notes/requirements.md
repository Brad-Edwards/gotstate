I want to create a hierarchical FSM library. I don't want the requirements to be language specific. I want the requirements to be sufficient for a principal software engineer to take them and start implementation design. I want the library to be ready for production use, but it doesn't need to have every bell and whistle. Just the most common ones. Critique these requirements as an expert principal software engineer. Are they ready for designing the library's architecture?

# Hierarchical State Machine Library Requirements - Version 4.1

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a hierarchical finite state machine (FSM) library intended for production use. The library **must** be language-agnostic and suitable for implementation in multiple programming languages. It is designed to provide a solid foundation for state machine behaviors, focusing on the most common and essential functionalities necessary for a principal software engineer to commence implementation design.

## 2. Terms and Definitions

### 2.1 State Machine

- **2.1.1** A computational model consisting of states, transitions between those states, and actions.
- **2.1.2** At any given time, the state machine has exactly one active state at each level of its hierarchy.
- **2.1.3** Processes events according to defined rules, triggering transitions and actions.
- **2.1.4** Supports hierarchical nesting of states (composite states), allowing complex behaviors to be modeled efficiently.
- **2.1.5** Operates in both synchronous and asynchronous modes, depending on the implementation and usage context.
- **2.1.6** **Deterministic Behavior**: Given a current state and an event, the resulting state and actions are predictable and consistent.

### 2.2 State

- **2.2.1** A distinct condition or situation in the state machine where specific actions are performed or awaited.
- **2.2.2** Has a unique identifier within its parent composite state to ensure clarity.
- **2.2.3** May contain **entry actions** executed upon entering the state and **exit actions** executed upon exiting.
- **2.2.4** Can be a **composite state**, containing child states, forming a hierarchical structure.
- **2.2.5** May store associated data of user-defined types, accessible during its active period.
  - **2.2.5.1** State data **must** be encapsulated within the state and accessible only to that state and its child states unless explicitly shared.
  - **2.2.5.2** State data **must** adhere to thread safety requirements as defined in Section 3.5.
  - **2.2.5.3** State data **must not** be directly accessible by sibling or parent states unless provided through defined interfaces.

  - **2.2.6.2** If no initial state is defined, the state machine **must** raise a configuration error during validation.
- **2.2.7** **Fallback State**: A predefined state the state machine transitions to when encountering an unrecoverable error.
  - **2.2.7.1** The fallback state **must** be defined at the top-level state machine or within composite states as appropriate.
  - **2.2.7.2** If a fallback state is not defined, the state machine **must** provide default error handling as specified in Section 3.4.3.

### 2.3 Transition

- **2.3.1** A directed link between a source state and a target state, representing a state change in response to an event.
