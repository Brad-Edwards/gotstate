# MODULE SPECIFICATIONS

## hsm.core.state_machine

### Public Interfaces

- StateMachine (concrete implementation of AbstractStateMachine)
- CompositeStateMachine (adds hierarchical handling)
- Type hints: StateMachine.start() -> None, StateMachine.process_event(event: Event) -> None Async Protocols:
- If async variant provided, AsyncStateMachine in hsm.runtime.async_support.
- Resource Handling: Internal locks for thread safety.
- Extensions: Allows plugging in custom AbstractValidator.
- Allows hooking error recovery strategies.

### hsm.core.states

- State, CompositeState classes
- Manages entry/exit actions, state data initialization/cleanup
- Type hints for state data: State.data: Dict[str, Any]
- Extension points: Custom data initializers from plugins.

### hsm.core.transitions

- Transition class implementing AbstractTransition
- Prioritization logic
- Guard checks, action execution, fallback states
- Extension: Custom prioritization policies via plugins.

### hsm.core.events

- Event class implementing AbstractEvent
- Timeout events, priority handling
- Extension: Custom event subclasses

### hsm.core.guards

- Built-in guard conditions
- Extension: User can provide guards in hsm.plugins.custom_guards

### hsm.core.actions

- Built-in actions
- Extension: User-defined actions in hsm.plugins.custom_actions

#### hsm.core.data_management

- Tools for state data scoping and thread safety
- Context managers for data locking

### hsm.core.hooks

- Hook registration and execution logic
- Extension: Plugins for logging/monitoring

### hsm.core.errors

- hsm.core.validation
- Validator class implementing AbstractValidator
- Integration with construction-time and runtime checks
- Extension: Custom validation rules

### hsm.runtime.executor

- Async event queue variants

### hsm.runtime.timers

- Timeout event scheduling
- Extension: Custom timing sources if needed

### hsm.runtime.concurrency

- Locks, threading primitives
- Ensuring atomic transitions

### hsm.plugins.*

- Example plugins for logging, monitoring
- Custom guard/action definitions

## INTER-MODULE CONTRACTS

### Import Graph

- `hsm.core.*` does not depend on `hsm.runtime.*` (core is independent of runtime mode).
- `hsm.runtime.*` depends on `hsm.core./*` for definitions of states, events.
- `hsm.interfaces.*` is independent and can be imported by `both hsm.core` and `hsm.runtime`.
- `hsm.plugins.*` may depend on `hsm.core` or `hsm.runtime` but not vice versa.

### Async Boundaries

- `hsm.runtime.async_support` provides async variants of event processing. Core modules remain sync-first, enabling a clean async boundary.

### Resource Lifecycle

- States own their data; cleaned up on exit.
- State machine owns event queue; cleaned up on shutdown.
- Timers are cleaned up when state machine stops.

### Error Handling

- Errors raised in `hsm.core.*` bubble up to the state machine level, possibly triggering fallback states.
- `hsm.runtime.*` catches and logs exceptions, may re-raise as HSMError subclasses.

### Initialization Order

- Define machine (states, transitions) in `hsm.core` before starting runtime in hsm.runtime.
- Validation happens after construction, before start.

### Cleanup Requirements

- `hsm.core` ensures state data cleanup after transitions.
- `hsm.runtime` ensures event queues are flushed on stop.
- Plugins must follow documented cleanup hooks.

This specification provides a structured blueprint for implementing the hierarchical state machine library. It addresses the requirements from architectural design, interface definitions, module responsibilities, inter-module contracts, and API stability while remaining consistent with Pythonâ€™s best practices and allowing for future extension and customization.
